# BLECommunication
Android communicate with iOS using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)

BLE has two modes
__Central__ and __Peripheral__

Android has supportted Central mode since android 4.3 (API 18). The Peripheral mode starts from android 5.0 with some special devices like Nexus 6 and Nexus 9. 

Check this [stackoverflow link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19717902/does-android-kitkat-allows-devices-that-support-bluetooth-le-to-act-as-a-periphe?lq=1) for detail

In this example, iOS acts as peripheral role while Android acts as central role.
